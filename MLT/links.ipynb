    "\n",
    "Deep trees with many leaves tend to **overfit** because predictions are based on limited historical data from just a few houses at each leaf.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, shallow trees with few leaves **underfit** by failing to capture important distinctions in the raw data.\n",

    "### The Overfitting-Underfitting Tradeoff\n",
    "\n",
    "Even advanced modeling techniques struggle with balancing underfitting and overfitting. Many modern models employ clever strategies to improve performance.\n",

    "Random forests address this by:\n",
    "- Using **multiple decision trees**\n",
    "- Making predictions through **ensemble averaging**\n",
    "Key advantages:\n",
    "1. Better predictive accuracy than single trees\n",
    "2. Robust performance with default parameters\n",
