##This project was inspired by and heavily influenced by the book Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow (2nd Edition) by AurÃ©lien GÃ©ron. A huge shoutout to AurÃ©lien GÃ©ron for creating such an incredible resource for learning machine learning and deep learning in a practical and hands-on way.

###About This Project

In this repository, I have compiled my learnings, exercises, and experiments based on the knowledge gained from the book. The book provided me with a strong foundation in:

Supervised and unsupervised learning

Deep learning using TensorFlow and Keras

Data preprocessing and feature engineering

Model evaluation and hyperparameter tuning

Various practical applications of ML/DL

###Purpose

The main goal of this repository is to document my learning journey, practice implementing ML concepts, and solidify my understanding by working through exercises and projects inspired by Hands-On Machine Learning.

###Acknowledgments

AurÃ©lien GÃ©ron for writing one of the best practical ML/DL books available.

The open-source community for providing excellent tools like Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, Pandas, NumPy, and more.

Anyone who shares knowledge and helps others learn!

If you are looking for a great resource to learn machine learning, I highly recommend checking out Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow.

Feel free to explore the notebooks and files in this repository. If you have any suggestions, insights, or improvements, I'd love to hear them!

Happy coding! ðŸš€
